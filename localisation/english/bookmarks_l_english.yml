 WELTPOLITIK_NAME:0 "The Age of Weltpolitik"
 WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Just some 2 decades ago, the German Empire had won the "Weltkrieg", the great war. German hegemony was established over europe, and painful treaties were enforced on the Entente, which led to a rise of ultranationalism and extremism, while the "Kaiserreich" had held out and maintained it's iron fist over europe. But all that changed in the Great Depression of 1929, which saw europe crumble, and extremists rising once again. While german hegemony was not yet shattered, the window of oppurtinity was opened for the former Entente - France, Britain and Russia - To strike once again, in hopes to regain the losses. The former Entente is rearming, the Reichspakt is revitalizing and preparing for another war. Another event like that in 1914 is inevitable, and only time will tell who will win the upcoming ocnflict."

 USA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "At one time, With isolationist policies, the U.S. seemed likely to become a superpower based on endless economic growth, enjoying a boom called the "Roaring Twenties". However, the catastrophe of 1929 led many countries, including the United States, to the depths of bankruptcy. But since 1933, the New Deal implemented by President Roosevelt began to revive the U.S. economy. Under a visible recovery, the United States appears to be back on its feet."

 ENG_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Britain was once called the "the empire on which the sun never sets" and it was a country that dominated the world with strong naval supremacy. But, the Great Empire, which used to control the entire planet with its powerful naval supremacy, has now handed it over to Germany. After the fall of the French Republic, Britain lost its will to war and signed a peace treaty with Germany. From 1919 until now, the British government has had a lot of confusion, including three Dissolution of parliaments. From unpopular governments to troubles, the world is paying attention to who will end the chaotic state of affairs."

 FRA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "France was defeated in the Great War. In the midst of chaos, extremists marched through downtown Paris and this incident, called the Paris March, brought France under the one-man dictatorship of Georges Valois. Under Valois' rule, France has continued to build up its military strength, avoiding Germany's eyes, and Valois intends to break the Frankfurt Treaty within this year. Will France be able to bring Germany to its knees and get back on its feet like that day in 1807? Or will Germany take down Paris, just like that day in 1871 and 1919? No one can tell that."
 
 GER_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The victory of the Weltkrieg made the German Empire the world's most hegemonic power. The German Empire acquired a huge amount of territory in Africa from France and Britain and made their colonies into German possessions. From Mitel Africa to German East Asia. Germany, which has become an empire where the Second empire on which the sun never sets, seems like it will last forever. But Germany still has many problems. Today, Germany is at a crossroads in fate over its position as the world's most hegemonic power. Only God knows if Germany can continue to hold its hegemony."

 SOV_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The victory of the Red and White Civil War was won by the enemy and eventually Russia was transformed into a communist state. But, Because of Brest-Litovsk Treaties, the vast territory of Eastern Europe that Russia has secured over the centuries is now in Germany's hands. Also, the two factions within the Soviet Russia - the Stalinist and the Bukharinist - are always sharply divided, confusing state affairs. The Soviet Russia is waiting for someone to end this mess..."

 AUH_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Austria is one of the country which won the Great War. But this dual empire of Austrians and Hungarians and Slavs and so on is still confused by ethnic issues. Kaiser Karl I wants to solve the problems of the empire as soon as possible. The fate of the empire is fast approaching. Depending on Kaiser's choice, the empire could be sustained, or it could collapse."

 TUR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Empire is one of the victors of the Great War. This has contributed significantly to the Ottoman Empire's continued existence. But as time goes by, ethnism has risen it's head and it made a huge disarray. Also the empire plagued by backward economies and military systems to match its nickname of sick man of Europe. Reform is almost essential for the Ottoman Empire, and maintaining the status quo will inevitably drive the empire to collapse. Minority issues, economic issues, and military issues are putting the Ottoman Empire in a difficult position. If it doesn't change in a turbulent world, all that awaits is only collapse."

 ITA_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Italy was one of the losers of World War I. They had to give Austria the northeastern lands. Vittorio Emmanuel III came down from the throne bearing the responsibility for the defeat, and Umberto II, who succeeded him, was also deposed shortly thereafter with the country's transformation into a republic. Since then, Italy has been in a state of extreme political turmoil, and the Great Depression of 1929 completely destroyed Italy's politics and economy. The national chaos became the growth engine of far-right fascist forces, which led to the party's landslide victory in the 1933 general election in Italy."

 SPR_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Spain is one of the few countries that escaped from the aftermath of the Great War. Born in 1935, the Second Republic of Spain has enormous internal turmoil caused by ideological conflicts. The election in February 1937 will determine Spain's future. In the run-up to this general election, internal conflict is deepening again, and maybe violence is the only way to end these conflicts."

 GRE_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After World War I, Greece faced a series of very chaotic situations. Defeat in the Great War forced Greece to pay huge amounts of compensation, plus political and economic turmoil. Nevertheless, many people have a dream of recovering Goto, called "Megali Idea," and have a glimmer of hope."

 BUL_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "After three Balkan wars, Bulgaria became the sole hegemonic power of the Balkans. Serbia, competing with Bulgaria, became a vassal state of Austria-Hungary, and Greece fell with great defeat. But decades after World War I. Greece and Romania began to threaten Bulgaria. If there is no preparation for this, maybe Bulgaria will lose its war against them."

 JAP_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The only successful modernization in East Asia, the Empire of Japan succeeded in becoming the strongest country in Asia by winning the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War in succession. However, the defeat in World War I, Showa financial crisis, and the Great Depression all but destroyed Japan, and Japanese politics became very confused. The Japanese military continues its attempts to dominate politics. At the end of this crisis the future of Japan will be determined."

 FNG_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "The Fengtian Clique is the only Beiyang Clique that has survived from the Kuomintang Northern Expedition by the Nationalist Party in the past. It succeeded in preventing the Kuomintang Army with the help of Japan and Germany, especially Germany, but as Japan's influence inside the Fengtian grew, Germany began to help Kuomintang, not the Fengtian. Amid the ongoing dispute between the two warlords – the Fengtian government and the Kuomintang Government – over the mainland China – the question of who will succeed in unifying China is at argument for many political and diplomatic scholars."

 CHI_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Sun Yat-sen realized his dream of becoming a republic on the continent in 1911. However, the dream of a democratic republic ended with the reality of Yuan Shai and the warlords era. Nonetheless, Challenge of Sun Yat-sen to establish a true republic came to a climax in the, Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition. However, Germany and Japan obstructed the revolution to only half success, and China was divided into the Beiyang Government and the Nationalist Government. The failure of the northern conquest also significantly weakened Chiang Kai-shek's position. However, the Kuomintang's will to invade the North is still firmly established, and they want to unify China by any means."

 SAF_WELTPOLITIK_DESC:0 "Britain was defeated in the Great War. At the end of the war, German forces were stretching across the Suez Canal toward all of Africa, and Britain was forced to signe a peace treaty with Germany to prevent further loss of its colonies. This treaty separated South Africa from the Commonwealth and became a republic. However, this deeply racist country is fostering a serious division between British-South Africans, Boers, blacks and Collard. It is making our country very dangerous."
