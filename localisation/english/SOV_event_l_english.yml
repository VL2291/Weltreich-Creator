 Soviet.13.a:0 "Cowards."
 Soviet.14.t:0 "The Center"
 Soviet.14.d:0 "Stalin served as interim Bolshevik Representative in Russia during the October Revolution, while Lenin and key Bolshevik officials were in exile, fleeing the oppression of Alexander Kerensky. This greatly helped Stalin grow politically, and Stalin grew significantly in Soviet politics through his unique outstanding political skills. As opposed to this, the Buharin faction in the [SOV.GetName] began to grow and confront Stalin, and the Congress of People's Deputies of the [SOV.GetName] became a political battlefield between Stalin and Buharin. Stalin succeeded in becoming the leader of the [SOV.GetName], but his political adversaries are still after him. His heavy industry-focused economic plans and excellent political skills will strengthen the [SOV.GetName], but his terrible paranoia and brutality will probably weaken the [SOV.GetName] significantly."
 Soviet.14.a:0 "”I trust no one, not even myself.”"
 Soviet.15.t:0 "Right Opposition"
 Soviet.15.d:0 "Bukharin, who once advocated left-wing communism and aimed for a global revolution, gradually began to adapt to reality over time, and he joined hands with veteran Bolsheviks who were at odds with him to form the Right Opposition. Fearing that the [SOV.GetName] was going to grow rapidly, Germany needed a force against the center, the main faction of the [SOV.GetName], and as a result, the Right Opposition began to grow with continuous support from Germany. Bukharin's faction has become so huge that it threatens Stalin, and now he's looking higher than his position. Buharin's New Economic Policy calls for intensive investment in light industry and gradual promotion of heavy industry. This might create an industrial disadvantage in future wars, but at least he's not going to kill a lot of innocent people and create a completely incompetent administration or army."
 Soviet.15.a:0 "“Christian love, which applies to all, even to one’s enemies, is the worst adversary of Communism.”"
 Soviet.16.t:0 "Left Opposition"
 Soviet.16.d:0 "Lev Trotsky was a genius that helped the [SOV.GetName] win the Russian Civil War. But he lost the power struggle with his arrogant and dogmatic character, and now he is effectively exiled to Siberia. And yet his genius brain and his idealistic ideas have been exemplified by many, and he still has his followers in the [SOV.GetName]. It's going to be very difficult for him to come to power, but if he becomes the leader of the [SOV.GetName], the [SOV.GetName] will definitely become a superpower."
 Soviet.16.a:0 "“Everything is relative in this world, where change alone endures.”"
 Soviet.17.t:0 "White Army"
 Soviet.17.d:0 "In 1917, the Russian Civil War broke out and Russia was divided into two factions: the red army and the white army. The goddess of victory ruled in favor of the red army, and Russia became a communist nation. Inside Russia, the White Army collapsed, but its leaders are still active in foreign countries. Kerensky, who defected to the United States, and Kolchak, who defected to Germany, dream of their respective ideals and look forward to the day they return to Russia. If Kerensky takes control of Russia, Russia will become a democracy, and if Kolchak takes control, Russia will become a militaristic state."
 Soviet.17.a:0 "White Army and Black Baron..."
 Soviet.18.t:0 "Set Country's Course"

 Soviet.19.t:0 "Trial for Zinoviev"
 Soviet.19.d:0 "Today morning, a Moscow court ruled against Zinoviev and 14 others. They were accused of assassinating Kirov a few weeks ago and inciting anti-Bolshevik incitement. They were each sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison, while Zinoviev, identified as the mastermind, was sentenced to deportation. They were charged with various operations, poisoning and sabotage during the trial, and were also convicted of these charges. This is the first heavy sentence for a senior Bolshevik politician who founded the [SOV.GetName] with Lenin after the Trotsky incident. Maybe, Stalin started a great purge."
 Soviet.19.a:0 "The prelude to a terrible thing"
 Soviet.20.t:0 "Trial for Trotsky"
 Soviet.20.d:0 "Yesterday evening, a second trial was held in Moscow. This was a trial against Trotsky and his followers, all of whom were charged with treason and espionage.

 Soviet.20.a:0 "A Mad Purge"
 Soviet.21.t:0 "Purge on Officers"
 Soviet.21.d:0 "Finally, the Masu of the purge reached into the interior of the Soviet army. Last night, several senior military officials were suddenly taken away by political police, who are said to be under investigation for treason. This means that the military is no longer safe from purging."
 Soviet.21.a:0 "It's terrifying"
 Soviet.22.t:0 "Trial for Bukharin"
 Soviet.22.d:0 "The final trial of Buharin and the traitor was held today. They were arrested a week ago on charges of treason and all of them were finally convicted. Buharin was exiled to Siberia, and the rest were sentenced to severe punishment. And hereby Stalin is actually able to take control of the [SOV.GetName], and it's likely that a major clean-up of the remnants of the clique that threatened Stalin will begin."
 Soviet.22.a:0 ""And it came to the end.""
 Soviet.23.t:0 "Bukharin took a Power"
 Soviet.23.d:0 "Stalin's purge threat made the anti-Stalin factions in the [SOV.GetName] feel a great sense of crisis, which in turn led to them fighting against Stalin.

 Soviet.29.t:0 "Attenuated aftermath of the purge"
 Soviet.29.d:0 "The whole society has been stagnant for some time in the aftermath of a series of purges a few months ago. But now that social phenomenon has begun to fade away and society has begun to regain its vitality."
 Soviet.29.a:0 "That's a good sign."
 Soviet.31.t:0 "Request for Cooperation of Bukharin"
 Soviet.31.d:0 "Yesterday evening Buharin approached our government in secret, calling for increased support against Stalin. Since Stalin came to power, our government has continued to support Buharin and has thrown the [SOV.GetName] into chaos. But in recent years, Stalin has begun to rapidly expand his power, and Buharin seems to feel threatened. Our decision is..."

After looking around for a while, he began to walk toward the bartender. The\n"Ilyich Ulyanov"\nbartender listened to his meaningful words and glanced at him, before moving his steps somewhere. Without saying a word, the man began to walk along the leading bartender. The bartender stopped at a door and slipped aside, as if to go in there. When the man opened the door, the attention of the people in the room was instantly focused.\nIt's an atmosphere that doesn't seem normal at all. It didn't seem like a place to be in an ordinary bar.\n"Finally, you come, Comrade"\nsaid one of the people in the room, while the silence remained.\n"Come on in. We have a lot to talk about."\nThe man crossed the door into the room. The door closed at the same time."

 Soviet.35.d:0 "Yesterday evening, a very surprising news came from the [SOV.GetName]. Stalin, the leader of the [SOV.GetName], loses power and Bukharin became the new leader of the [SOV.GetName]. Bukharin has long competed politically against Stalin, and has been trying to push him away. And his efforts eventually paid off and Bukharin became the supreme leader of the [SOV.GetName]. Stalin is currently missing, and some have expressed doubts that he has already been executed somewhere. With Bukharin in power, the [SOV.GetName] is expected to face major economic, diplomatic, and political changes."

Only then did Trotsky raise his head and look at Bukharin.\n"What's the matter, comrade?"\n"Are you asking because you don’t know?" Bukharin's face was red as if he were very angry.\n"Obviously, you said that if I cooperate with you, you would put me in charge of the People's Commissar. But look, you put me in a low position!"\n"Comrade, I said I could, but I never said I would." Buharin trembled with anger at Trotsky's pun.\n"You had it coming."

 Soviet.50.d:0 "This morning in western Russia, a mass uprising was launched by the anti-communists.

 Soviet.51.d:0 "A series of huge battles throughout Russia eventually culminated in the victory of the Russian Republic. The Soviet army suffered enormous damage in the battle and suffered repeated losses, eventually losing the capital Moscow and giving in completely to the White Army. This is the opposite of the Red Army's victory over the White Army in the first civil war in the past, and Russia has entered an era of capitalism again.
