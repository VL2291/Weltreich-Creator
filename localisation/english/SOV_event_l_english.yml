 Soviet.13.d:0 "The Soviet government was not happy with our proposal and eventually expressed its intention to reject it. The Soviets didn't seem to want much of an alliance with us and they were afraid that this alliance would provoke Germany."
 Soviet.13.a:0 "Cowards."
 Soviet.14.t:0 "The Center"
 Soviet.14.d:0 "Stalin served as interim Bolshevik Representative in Russia during the October Revolution, while Lenin and key Bolshevik officials were in exile, fleeing the oppression of Alexander Kerensky. This greatly helped Stalin grow politically, and Stalin grew significantly in Soviet politics through his unique outstanding political skills. As opposed to this, the Buharin faction in the [SOV.GetName] began to grow and confront Stalin, and the Congress of People's Deputies of the [SOV.GetName] became a political battlefield between Stalin and Buharin. Stalin succeeded in becoming the leader of the [SOV.GetName], but his political adversaries are still after him. His heavy industry-focused economic plans and excellent political skills will strengthen the [SOV.GetName], but his terrible paranoia and brutality will probably weaken the [SOV.GetName] significantly."
 Soviet.14.a:0 "”I trust no one, not even myself.”"
 Soviet.15.t:0 "Right Opposition"
 Soviet.15.d:0 "Bukharin, who once advocated left-wing communism and aimed for a global revolution, gradually began to adapt to reality over time, and he joined hands with veteran Bolsheviks who were at odds with him to form the Right Opposition. Fearing that the [SOV.GetName] was going to grow rapidly, Germany needed a force against the center, the main faction of the [SOV.GetName], and as a result, the Right Opposition began to grow with continuous support from Germany. Bukharin's faction has become so huge that it threatens Stalin, and now he's looking higher than his position. Buharin's New Economic Policy calls for intensive investment in light industry and gradual promotion of heavy industry. This might create an industrial disadvantage in future wars, but at least he's not going to kill a lot of innocent people and create a completely incompetent administration or army."
 Soviet.15.a:0 "“Christian love, which applies to all, even to one’s enemies, is the worst adversary of Communism.”"
 Soviet.16.t:0 "Left Opposition"
 Soviet.16.d:0 "Lev Trotsky was a genius that helped the [SOV.GetName] win the Russian Civil War. But he lost the power struggle with his arrogant and dogmatic character, and now he is effectively exiled to Siberia. And yet his genius brain and his idealistic ideas have been exemplified by many, and he still has his followers in the [SOV.GetName]. It's going to be very difficult for him to come to power, but if he becomes the leader of the [SOV.GetName], the [SOV.GetName] will definitely become a superpower."
 Soviet.16.a:0 "“Everything is relative in this world, where change alone endures.”"
 Soviet.17.t:0 "White Army"
 Soviet.17.d:0 "In 1917, the Russian Civil War broke out and Russia was divided into two factions: the red army and the white army. The goddess of victory ruled in favor of the red army, and Russia became a communist nation. Inside Russia, the White Army collapsed, but its leaders are still active in foreign countries. Kerensky, who defected to the United States, and Kolchak, who defected to Germany, dream of their respective ideals and look forward to the day they return to Russia. If Kerensky takes control of Russia, Russia will become a democracy, and if Kolchak takes control, Russia will become a militaristic state."
 Soviet.17.a:0 "White Army and Black Baron..."
 Soviet.18.t:0 "Set Country's Course"

 Soviet.19.t:0 "Trial for Zinoviev"
 Soviet.19.d:0 "Today morning, a Moscow court ruled against Zinoviev and 14 others. They were accused of assassinating Kirov a few weeks ago and inciting anti-Bolshevik incitement. They were each sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison, while Zinoviev, identified as the mastermind, was sentenced to deportation. They were charged with various operations, poisoning and sabotage during the trial, and were also convicted of these charges. This is the first heavy sentence for a senior Bolshevik politician who founded the [SOV.GetName] with Lenin after the Trotsky incident. Maybe, Stalin started a great purge."
 Soviet.19.a:0 "The prelude to a terrible thing"
 Soviet.20.t:0 "Trial for Trotsky"
 Soviet.20.d:0 "Yesterday evening, a second trial was held in Moscow. This was a trial against Trotsky and his followers, all of whom were charged with treason and espionage.

 Soviet.20.a:0 "A Mad Purge"
 Soviet.21.t:0 "Purge on Officers"
 Soviet.21.d:0 "Finally, the Masu of the purge reached into the interior of the Soviet army. Last night, several senior military officials were suddenly taken away by political police, who are said to be under investigation for treason. This means that the military is no longer safe from purging."
 Soviet.21.a:0 "It's terrifying"
 Soviet.22.t:0 "Trial for Bukharin"
 Soviet.22.d:0 "The final trial of Buharin and the traitor was held today. They were arrested a week ago on charges of treason and all of them were finally convicted. Buharin was exiled to Siberia, and the rest were sentenced to severe punishment. And hereby Stalin is actually able to take control of the [SOV.GetName], and it's likely that a major clean-up of the remnants of the clique that threatened Stalin will begin."
 Soviet.22.a:0 ""And it came to the end.""
 Soviet.23.t:0 "Bukharin took a Power"
 Soviet.23.d:0 "Stalin's purge threat made the anti-Stalin factions in the [SOV.GetName] feel a great sense of crisis, which in turn led to them fighting against Stalin.

 Soviet.25.t:0 "The Soviet Civilwar"

 Soviet.31.t:0 "Request for Cooperation of Bukharin"
 Soviet.31.d:0 "Yesterday evening Buharin approached our government in secret, calling for increased support against Stalin. Since Stalin came to power, our government has continued to support Buharin and has thrown the [SOV.GetName] into chaos. But in recent years, Stalin has begun to rapidly expand his power, and Buharin seems to feel threatened. Our decision is..."
 Soviet.31.a:0 "We will."
 Soviet.31.b:0 "No way."
 Soviet.32.t:0 "Germany agrees"

After looking around for a while, he began to walk toward the bartender. The\n"Ilyich Ulyanov"\nbartender listened to his meaningful words and glanced at him, before moving his steps somewhere. Without saying a word, the man began to walk along the leading bartender. The bartender stopped at a door and slipped aside, as if to go in there. When the man opened the door, the attention of the people in the room was instantly focused.\nIt's an atmosphere that doesn't seem normal at all. It didn't seem like a place to be in an ordinary bar.\n"Finally, you come, Comrade"\nsaid one of the people in the room, while the silence remained.\n"Come on in.

 Soviet.35.d:0 "Yesterday evening, a very surprising news came from the [SOV.GetName]. Stalin, the leader of the [SOV.GetName], loses power and Bukharin became the new leader of the [SOV.GetName]. Bukharin has long competed politically against Stalin, and has been trying to push him away. And his efforts eventually paid off and Bukharin became the supreme leader of the [SOV.GetName]. Stalin is currently missing, and some have expressed doubts that he has already been executed somewhere. With Bukharin in power, the [SOV.GetName] is expected to face major economic, diplomatic, and political changes."

Only then did Trotsky raise his head and look at Bukharin.\n"What's the matter, comrade?"\n"Are you asking because you don’t know?" Bukharin's face was red as if he were very angry.\n"Obviously, you said that if I cooperate with you, you would put me in charge of the People's Commissar. But look, you put me in a low position!"\n"Comrade, I said I could, but I never said I would." Buharin trembled with anger at Trotsky's pun.\n"You had it coming."

So the [SOV.GetName] becomes a civil war between Stalin, Bukharin, and Trotsky, and the war between these three factions will determine the fate of the [SOV.GetName].

 Soviet.42.t:0 "The end of the Soviet Civil War"
 Soviet.42.d:0 "The [SOV.GetName] of the Trotsky faction became the victor of the Soviet Civil War.

 Soviet.50.d:0 "This morning in western Russia, a mass uprising was launched by the anti-communists.

 Soviet.51.d:0 "A series of huge battles throughout Russia eventually culminated in the victory of the Russian Republic. The Soviet army suffered enormous damage in the battle and suffered repeated losses, eventually losing the capital Moscow and giving in completely to the White Army. This is the opposite of the Red Army's victory over the White Army in the first civil war in the past, and Russia has entered an era of capitalism again. A massive purge of Soviet communists will be unavoidable and it looks like there's going to be a lot of blood coming from Russia for a while."

The new federation has stepped on the global stage as a unified federation based on socialist theory and a new powerhouse.\nHeads of state from each republic were appointed to key government posts in the federation, claiming enthusiastically that 'our federation has faced its fate as the new pillar for the progress of human civilization and for true justice.'

 Soviet.63.d:0 "In the middle of the speech hall, a red flag stood tall. Carved with a gold hammer and a sickle, the flag was a symbol that promised prosperity, development, and revolution for the workers. However, Yuri knew that it was a cloth stained with ash and blood. Every time the flag waved, his eyes were reminded of the faces of the countless enemies he had killed.\n\n"Comrades," shouted the young political commissioner at the podium, his voice filling the room. "Today, we have taken the first steps to heal the divisions of the past, to establish a new supreme Soviet. The world's counter-revolutionaries have said that our revolution is over, but they are wrong. The revolution is not over, it has only begun!"\n\nAll the people in the speech hall applauded, but Yuri bowed his head. The applause sounded to him like a flame burning and breaking.

 Soviet.64.t:0 "The New Constitution"
 Soviet.64.d:0 "The Kremlin's cellar, where the new constitution was being drafted, was filled with stifling heat.

However, shouting and fistfights could be heard in a conference room full of ironclad issues.\n\n"We must not forget that we are building a new foundation for this country!" A member of the committee shouted in excitement. His hand was scrambling on the paper spread on the desk. However, the sentences left at each point where the tip of the pen passed could not be continued. To the other committee members, these were simple sentences that could collapse at any time, like a tilted tower.\n\n"Isn't that too much? I think the radical clause up to this point is going to be a problem for the future." Another pointed his finger at the desk. The "revolution" is over, but the language of the law remains unsettled and confusing. The young commissioner, red-faced and shouting "Capitalist Fracci," lunges at the desk. The provisions of the new constitution creaked and couldn't mesh like different cogs."
 Soviet.64.a:0 "What the hell kind of this is."
 Soviet.65.t:0 "Recovery"
 Soviet.65.d:0 ""Comrades! That's great news! Let's say our comrades on the front line have won!" When Ivan heard this, I couldn't remember what he had done. But I did remember the crowd cheering him on. In fact, he was a civil war, a revolution, and didn't know much about it. Isn't it the same to use the right time, whether they're both "Soviet"? But Ivan has known since his empire that, at least for now, taking sides with his defenders is how to live life without problems.\n\nFortunately, this government did meet Ivan's expectations. When the civil war ended, the government came up with a number of difficult measures that Ivan did not understand and stabilized the people's livelihoods that had been destroyed during the civil war. Of course, some people complained that it had only changed from a dilute porridge to a dilute borsch, but Ivan did not. Don't you remember the days of the Empire and the Red and White Civil War? Ivan wanted to give high marks to this government, which has at least made efforts for stability. He doesn't starve, eats three meals a day, gives him a house to avoid rain, travels around saying that it's for us, and if he can't do this, he's not a country."
 Soviet.65.a:0 "In any case, Ivan felt secure in his life."
 Soviet.66.t:0 "Under the Red Sky"
 Soviet.66.d:0 "He looked up at the sky. His entire life up to this point seemed to be beating him up like a midday rain. He resolved to always work for the people, and after shedding a lot of blood, he rose to the position.\n\n"Lenin, what should we do?"\n\nBukharin murmured quietly as he swept his head with his hand. Even though he had risen to the position of Supreme Leader. The revolution did not seem to stop yet.\n\nAbove all, he had the greatest enemy. Kaiserich in the west. The Germanic tribes that defeated both Britain and France, and overthrew even the founding Russia, which seemed immortalized. Those who humiliated us greatly with Brest Litovsk. It was obvious that they would invade the Soviet people first in the future. To prevent that, we must be strong. If you make the Soviet Union strong and preemptively strike Germany, you will have a chance of winning. Buharin's ideas were becoming more and more like the political opponents he hated without even realizing it.\n\nHe looked at the map. Germany oppressed the people of Ukraine, the Baltic, Belarus, and the vast land. Buharin shouted back to himself."
 Soviet.66.a:0 "Such a thing will never be repeated again."
 Soviet.67.t:0 "One Federation, Two Governments"
 Soviet.67.d:0 "The Soviet Union, which represents the people of all Russia, is divided. It is natural that efforts toward an unfinished socialist paradise are divided in many directions. Unfortunately, today's crisis is a rather unhealthy kind. \n\nPoor socialism is backward socialism. - The New Economic Policy (NEP), harshly criticized by Nikolai Buharin, is finally getting worse. The Red Army supports it nominally, but in fact, it is clear that what they really want is not economic policy. People who have visited Moscow at least once will see factional strife on every street they walk by. This is happening both at the administrative headquarters and at the military academies. In the situation the wounds of civil war couldn't close yet, society was divided into two.\n\nOur great Soviet Union is not united. The federal government and the military are at loggerheads and separate factional wars are going on. No one wants to succeed Kamenev, who is bent out of trying to hold hands with everyone in the world. Amid the conflict between Bukharin and Tukhachevsky, maybe the time for choice is coming."
 Soviet.67.a:0 "There can't be two stars in Russia."
 Soviet.68.t:0 "Communist Demonstrations"
 Soviet.68.d:0 "In recent years, anti-government protests calling for communism have increased dramatically. The government sees it as an operation by outside forces, and the leading candidate is Soviet Russia. They seem to incite our workers to induce various actions that undermine our national capacity. The government's response to them seems very important."
 Soviet.68.a:0 "Crack them down hard."
 Soviet.68.b:0 "Conciliate them."
 Soviet.68.c:0 "Leave it alone."
 Soviet.69.t:0 "Stalin and His Flock"
 Soviet.69.d:0 "At around 9 a.m. today, the trial began against Stalin and his flock, who are accused of state treason and of being revisionists against Marxism. A Moscow court sentenced them to a heavy sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison, while Stalin sentenced them to 30 years in prison. The historic moment came when the center of power that once held and shook the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\nContrary to what many had expected, Stalin was not sentenced to death, which may indicate that Buharin was quite conciliatory. Regardless, the Soviets are once again facing a new turning point. And the subsequent trial of Trotsky is also getting a lot of attention."
 Soviet.69.a:0 "It's the right punishment for traitors."
 Soviet.70.t:0 "Trotsky and His Flock"
 Soviet.70.d:0 "The trial began around 1 p.m. today against Trotsky, who faces charges of state treason and violations of anti-state thought prohibition laws, and the group that follows him. A Moscow court, like the last time, sentenced him to 10 to 20 years in prison, and sentenced him to deportation.\n\nPeople's prediction that the sentence would be similar to the previous Stalin's trial was right. No one was sentenced to death in this trial, which shows that Bukharin's governance is quite paternalistic. This has greatly reduced the fear of a large-scale political purge in society."
 Soviet.70.a:0 "We have punished the traitors."
 Soviet.71.t:0 "To an Unfamiliar Foreign Land"
 Soviet.71.d:0 "Mikhail Tutschevsky stood against the stern railing. The enemy aircraft flying in the wind on board was of the same kind as those caught in the old Kremlin spire, but seemed to him to be as shabby as ever. Why- indeed, no wonder. Just as everything in Western Russia had disappeared from Brest, Mikhail had lost all his influence. The current foe was just the end of a middle-aged man in a nice uniform. There was no strength in his body.\n\nIf you look back at the last 20 or so hours, it's just full of failures. The majority of the troops refused to accept my commanders' arguments, rather they were prone to gunfire. The plans for coup in Moscow and Leningrad have long since been exposed. The most reliable deputy was a subordinate to Buharin. Could he be worse than himself today? The core of rebellion is speed. Literally, Mikhail is the quickest general in Russia to fall.\n\nHe couldn't decide what to do. He just left the port in Leningrad with his passport and a little bit of rubles. His mother, who warmly surrounds our planet, gave no answer to him. Stars are overlapping today.\n\n'There is no shadow of the white seabirds. Even in the mast,'"
 Soviet.71.a:0 "'Even in the sea around there.'"
 Soviet.72.t:0 "Military Coup"
 Soviet.72.d:0 "Early this morning, rebels led by Tukhachevsky headed to the Kremlin in Moscow. Tukhachevsky's rebels tried to cross the barricades at the Kremlin, and government forces tried to forcefully deter them. The winner of this tight battle is..."
 Soviet.72.a:0 "His plan had been leaked and he failed to take over."
 Soviet.72.b:0 "He occupied the Kremlin."
 Soviet.73.t:0 "Political Purge"
 Soviet.73.d:0 "From this morning to this evening, hearings were held against numerous politicians involved in the Bolshevik. The trials against them were summary proceedings and proceeded very quickly. Almost all of the figures were sentenced to prison, and only a few were acquitted or found not guilty. The aftermath of this purge is expected to last quite a while."
 Soviet.73.a:0 "I'm afraid."
 Soviet.74.t:0 "Enactment of Parliamentary Act"
 Soviet.74.d:0 "Yesterday afternoon, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet enacted parliamentary act. It calls for the dissolution of all parties except one party illegal. The Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Tukhachevsky, called it a "special step" to unite the divided Soviet Union, and the bill is expected to completely solidify Tukhachevsky's one-man dictatorship."
 Soviet.74.a:0 "The Beginning of a Dictatorship."
 Soviet.75.t:0 "Search Operation Begins"
 Soviet.75.d:0 "A large-scale search operation has begun for Bukharin. He has been missing since Tukhachevsky took over the Kremlin Palace, and Tukhachevsky has organized a large force to capture him, one of the people's closest hits."
 Soviet.75.a:0 "Will the search succeed"
 Soviet.76.t:0 "Make a Successful Search"
 Soviet.76.d:0 "The search operation was successful. Bukharin was found cold in a corner of the Kremlin, where he was apparently shot dead during the coup. Prosecutors made no special charges against Bukharin, who had already died, along with prison sentences for members of his clique charged with treason."
 Soviet.76.a:0 "Finally Found Him."
 Soviet.77.t:0 "Didn't Make a Successful Search"
 Soviet.77.d:0 "Eventually, the search party could not find Bukharin. Without Bukharin, a trial was held against his flock in Moscow, and Bukharin and his flock were sentenced to death or imprisonment. Bukharin was sentenced to death but was not actually executed because he could not be found."
 Soviet.77.a:0 "Trial about Bukharin without Bukharin..."
 Soviet.78.t:0 "Execute Kollontai"
 Soviet.78.d:0 "This morning, there was the execution of Kollontai, who was sentenced to death for treason. He was one of the key figures in the Bukharin government and one of the leading 'traitors' from Tukhachevsky. His execution demonstrated to the public the establishment of a world of Tukhachevsky."
 Soviet.78.a:0 "Goodbye."
 Soviet.79.t:0 "Troika Punishment"
 Soviet.79.d:0 "This morning, a formal trial was held against the Troikas. Stalin, Trotsky and Zinoviev were sentenced to death, while other Trojans were sentenced to decades in prison. It illustrated the fall of the Bolshevik Central Powers in the past."
 Soviet.79.a:0 "Power disappears in a day."
 Soviet.80.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective]-Sponsored Rallies in the Capital"
 Soviet.80.d:0 "A number of political groups have announced rallies in the capital this week. They don't seem to have any specific grievances they want to air, beyond a general sense that we should try to improve our relations with [FROM.GetNameDef], and remove any politicians critical of the [FROM.GetAdjective] administration from any positions of power.\n\nWhile it is possible that these demonstrations are just spontaneous manifestations of the popular opinion, it is at least remarkable that a number of key organizers travelled to [FROM.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] recently, and seemed to have begun agitating for this upon their return."
 Soviet.80.a:0 "Well, that is certainly their right."
 Soviet.80.b:0 "Send in the police to bash some heads!"
 Soviet.81.t:0 "Soviet Russia's call to participate in anti-German front"
 Soviet.81.d:0 "Soviet Russia has asked us to secretly participate in the anti-German front, along with a request for arms aid. It seems that they, like us, also have a vengeance to take revenge on Germany. A secret agreement with them seems to be of great interest to us."
 Soviet.81.a:0 "Great!"
 Soviet.81.b:0 "We don't need them."
 Soviet.82.t:0 "France agreed to our request"
 Soviet.82.d:0 "The French government agreed to form an anti-German front with us and gave us thousands of infantry equipment, which is very good news for us and will be a step towards taking down Germany."
 Soviet.82.a:0 "They are wise friends."
 Soviet.83.t:0 "France rejected our request"
 Soviet.83.d:0 "The French government rejected all our requests. They don't seem to have any intention of working with us to attack Germany. This is not very good news."
 Soviet.83.a:0 "We're good enough for ourselves, too."
 Soviet.84.t:0 "Coup in Moscow"
 Soviet.84.d:0 "Foreign media in Moscow reported on the shootout at dawn. Martial law was imposed in the Western Russian military districts and party forces were established in two of Russia's most iconic cities. General Mikhail Nikolajevich Tutschevsky was seen entering the Kremlin, and international politics pointed to him as a political upheaval.\n\nThe 'most revolutionary general in all Russia' was considered the heavyweight of the Red Army. Arguments are being made over whether his coup d'etat was accidental or long-prepared. But the majority agree: Soviet civil control failed.\n\nThe German ambassador to Moscow had no comment on today's situation. Many are paying attention to whether the Berlin-Moscow relationship will be affected."
 Soviet.84.a:0 "Finally, it happened."

 soviet_rework_troika.001.d:0 "On the 6th of January 1936, it had finally happened.\nWhat we had long awaited was now a reality - Kamenev had joined the ranks of Lenin in a fate similar to his, and now they both would no longer be there to lead the glorious RSFSR.\nEver since the incident the Troika - made up of Iosif Stalin, Lev Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev - had prepared to take control of the RSFSR's leadership, and with that usher in a new age for the Republic. But to no surprise, they were met with resistance ever since the Troika's etsablishment, and if they will actually seize the leadership succesfully is now the question, as a battle between all those who want to decide the Republic's future breaks out."
